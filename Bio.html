    <h1>A Bit About Myself...</h1>
    
    <p><span>I am a senior studying Cognitive and Brain Science</span> at Tufts University in Medford, MA. Studying the fascinatingly complex
    nature of the human mind has remained an exciting and humbling experience. I am passionate about researching and demystefying
    the tangeled mess that is human perception and behavior. As I inch closer to graduation day, I look forward to pursuing
    a field in which I can research how people and technology may interact to facilitate collaboration, learning, and innovation. 
    </p>
    
    <p><span>I have an insatiable addiction to travelling.</span> There are very few countries in the World to which 
    I would not go and very few foods that I would not try at least once. I prefer spending my time enjoying the outdoors 
    but I can always make room for a good TV show or movie. I drink fine beer and brew my own, as well. I like to cook, 
    but I am much better at eating.
